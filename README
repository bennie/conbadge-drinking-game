The Conbadge Drinking Game

Certain overused badge name componenets are are a reason to drink.

Much like there are 5 fingers on a sober person's hand, there are 5 categories of fruity name components:

* Animals
* Colors
* Elements
* Seasons
* Celestials

ANIMALS: These are your normal animal names. (IE: fox, dog, tiger, 
wolf.) This includes cutsey variants (poni, wuffie, etc), mythical animals 
(unicorn, dragon), and latin variants (canis, vupline)

COLORS: What it says: red, green, blue, grey, etc.

ELEMENTS: These include classical elements (water,wind,fire,earth), 
metals (bronze,gold,silver) and jewels (emerald,ruby,etc.)

SEASONS: Summer, Winter, Fall, and Spring.

CELESTIALS: Things that fall in sort of a hippy-dippy view of the world. Astronomy (sun, moon, star), Weather (storm, thunder, snow, sky, shadow), and various god variants (angel, demon, god, goddess, anubis, etc)


For the heavy drinkers in the crowd, there are bonus drinks and half drinks:


CUTESY: Odd spellings like "wyld" and items like "fluffy" and "sparkle."
TITLES: Sir, Baron, Princess, etc
PEDANTIC: Having the word "the" in your name.
